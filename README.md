Normally Office Excel does not allow DMS calculations to be performed on cells. It is possible to do the calculation by using multiple cells and complicated conversion formulas, but it is very difficult. Therefore, we have developed a VBA Script that can perform DMS calculations on cells and still perform function calculations. Please check the following Demo for a simple usage. ðŸŒµ

Various functions can be auto-completed by entering the following prefixes on the cells.
```
=sok_
```

<br>

### Features
- [x] Add and range specification.
- [ ] Simplified handling of negative numbers.
- [x] Azimuth Logic.
- [x] Calculation of cos sin.
- [x] Add Compass
- [x] String to Decimal func.
- [ ] Refactoring.

<br>

### Usage

1.  Open Excel and VBA Editor.

2.  Add main.vbs as a new module.

3.  Use the functions provided in the script to perform calculations on your data.

> [!Note]  
> This script is designed to work with Excel and VBA, and it may not function correctly in other environments.

### Example

```python
A1 = 179Â°50â€²0â€³
B1 = 0Â°10â€²0â€³

=sok_add(A1, B1) #180Â°0â€²0â€³
```

<br>

```python
A1 = 180Â°50â€²0â€³
B1 = 0Â°50â€²0â€³

=sok_sub(A1, B1) #180Â°0â€²0â€³
```

<br>

```python
A1 = 179Â°30â€²0â€³
A2 = 0Â°10â€²0â€³
A3 = 0Â°20â€²0â€³

=sok_sumAll(A1:A3) #180Â°0â€²0â€³
```
