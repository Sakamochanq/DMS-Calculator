Normally Office Excel does not allow DMS calculations to be performed on cells. It is possible to do the calculation by using multiple cells and complicated conversion formulas, but it is very difficult. Therefore, we have developed a VBA Script that can perform DMS calculations on cells and still perform function calculations. Please check the following Demo for a simple usage. 🌵

Various functions can be auto-completed by entering the following prefixes on the cells.
```
=sok_
```

- [ ] Refactoring.

<br>

### Usage

1.  Open Excel and VBA Editor.

2.  Add main.vbs as a new module.

3.  Use the functions provided in the script to perform calculations on your data.

### Example

```python
A1 = 179°50′0″
B1 = 0°10′0″

=sok_add(A1, B1) #180°0′0″
```

<br>

```python
A1 = 180°50′0″
B1 = 0°50′0″

=sok_sub(A1, B1) #180°0′0″
```

<br>

```python
A1 = 179°30′0″
A2 = 0°10′0″
A3 = 0°20′0″

=sok_sumAll(A1:A3) #180°0′0″
```
